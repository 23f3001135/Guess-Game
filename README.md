# ðŸ¦€ Guess Game

**Guess Game** is a minimalist terminal-based number guessing game built in Rust. It's a great starting point for anyone learning the language, covering essential concepts like:

- User input and output
- Looping constructs
- Random number generation
- Error handling

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

You're prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100. The game tells you what you guessed, and you keep going â€” until you win! (add your own winning logic if you'd like!)
